    "Trees are heirachical data structures, It consist of nodeds, a node can be a parent or child. The first at the top of the treeis the root of the tree and every node  (root, parent or child) may be connected to a maximimum of two nodes called it's childrens. A node that does not have children is called a leaf node. \n",
