    "Using prefix sums to compute range sums is efficient when the array is static because a single prefix sum array allows constant-time queries for any range. However, when the array can be updated frequently, prefix sums become inefficient because every update would require recomputing the prefix sums for all subsequent elements, leading to O(n) time per update. This is why data structures like the Fenwick Tree and segment trees were created: they allow both point updates and range sum queries in O(log n) time, efficiently handling dynamic arrays without recomputing the entire prefix sum after each change.\n",

    "In a Fenwick Tree, each node (cell of the array) at index i is responsible for a contiguous range of elements in the original array, and the size of this range is determined by the least significant bit of i. To find the range that a node covers, you compute the LSB using (we can use i & -i, this is a shortcut to get LSB). The range of the original array that tree[i] stores is from i - lsb(i) + 1 to i inclusive. Fenwick Trees are implemented as 1-indexed arrays, so the first index tree[0] is left unused because the LSB of 0 is 0, which would cause infinite loops in the update and prefix sum operations. Every element of the original array at index j corresponds to the node at index j + 1 in the tree, ensuring that the LSB calculations and range sums work correctly."
